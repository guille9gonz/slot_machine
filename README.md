# Slot Machine ðŸŽ°

## Overview
Implement a slot machine game in Python. The user decides the initial amount of money and is asked how many lines they want to bet on (1 to 3) and how much money to bet per line. 
Afterward, a spin is generated using letters (A, B, C, D) as symbols. If there is a match of three identical symbols in a row, the user wins an amount based on which symbol appears (three A's give the most money, as they are less likely to appear than D's).
